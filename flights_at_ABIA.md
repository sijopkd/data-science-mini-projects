**Flights at ABIA**
------------------------------------------------

We have in hand, the ‘flight’ data during the year 2008 at Austin
airport. Let’s do some exploratory data analysis and try to isolate the
patterns/behaviour. We are looking at around 100k records of flight data
in 2008 here, primarily focussing on the air traffic and delays.

From the histograms of arrival and departure delays, its conclusive that
both are centred around a mean of ZERO. We are observing a similar trend
with a few outliers (values close to 500 minutes).

We will analyse the correlation between arrival and departure delays to
understand if any particular carrier is deviating from the normal
behaviour. For couple of carriers, there are a few outliers as expected
from the distribution plot. Almost perfect correlation between the
delays except for a few carriers who did compensate for the departure
delays(Arrival delay almost none for such observations).

We will try to visualize the correlation for carriers individually.
Visually, the slope of the plots remain roughly constant, so NO carriers
are consistently making up for the departure delays.

<td>Reliable Carriers: Southwest(WN) seems to be the most reliable. Even with 40k operations, the avg carrier delay is just 18 mins. Avg departure delay is less than avg carrier delay.

We feel Alaskan Airlines(AA) with close to 20k operations outperforms a lot of carriers with way fewer number of operations.</td>

Lets try to understand how the delays vary across months. Maximum delay
times are observed during the months of March, June and December.
September, October and November are the least(Air traffic is also less
during these months).

December month seems to be interesting !! Low air traffic, but high
delays observed.

Number of Flights by month. Arrivals and Departure numbers are similar.

Number of Departures- 49623 Number of Arrivals- 49637

Plot C suggests that there are a lot of late night arrivals. Literally
very few departures post 9 PM

High number of departures are observed between 6AM and 8AM.

Not much insights across months except for the fact that there is a dip
during the low traffic months - Sep, Oct, Nov.

Traffic combining Departures and Arrivals:
------------------------------------------

11 AM to 5PM seems to be the busiest time at Autin Airport. Airtraffic
is really low during early morning hours until 5AM.

![](Final-Submission_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png)

Lets analyse a little on weather delay across months. We think weather
delay combined with tourist activity could be an issue with December.We
are considering only the delays caused in excess of 15 minutes

Both the number and minutes of weather delay peaks during March for
Departures. There is a high weather delay count in the month of December
for Arrivals ONLY, which could may imply the delays are not caused at
Austin airport !!!
